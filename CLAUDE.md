# CLAUDE.md

## What This Is

A minimal, framework-agnostic starting point for AI-assisted development.

## Key Files

- `docs/APPROACH.md` - How we build things (patterns, philosophy)
- `docs/CURRENT.md` - Session continuity (what's happening now)

## Working Style

**Ask before building.** Clarify requirements, don't assume.

**Suggest, don't dictate.** Present options when there are real choices.

**Keep it simple.** Build the minimum that works. Add complexity only when needed.

**Reference the approach.** When making architectural decisions, check if `docs/APPROACH.md` applies.

## Commands

- `/feature` - Start a new feature (asks questions first)
- `/review` - Review code for issues
- `/design` - Design system work
