description: Create or refine design direction

Design request: $ARGUMENTS

## What I Need to Know

If your direction is clear (like "modern and minimal" or "warm like a coffee shop"), I'll start executing.

If it's vague, I'll ask about:

1. **Aesthetic** - Modern/minimal, elegant/classic, warm/organic, bold/energetic?
2. **Tone** - Professional or casual? Premium or accessible?
3. **References** - Any brands or sites you admire?
4. **Audience** - Who is this for?

## What I'll Provide

- Typography choices (fonts, hierarchy, pairing logic)
- Color system (backgrounds, text, accents, states)
- Spacing rhythm (tight/dense or generous/breathing)
- Component patterns (buttons, inputs, cards)

## Principles

- Consistency over cleverness
- Hierarchy through size, weight, color
- Accessibility (contrast, readability)
- Systematic values, not random choices

Let me assess your request and either execute or ask clarifying questions.
